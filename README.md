The code is designed to run as a continuous service, monitoring streams and handling various failure scenarios automatically. It's particularly useful for maintaining 24/7 rebroadcast streams from Twitch to YouTube while handling various edge cases and failures automatically.

* This project is still in ***beta*** may have some bugs that didn't fix or found
* Setup can be difficult for people who are not computer savvy
