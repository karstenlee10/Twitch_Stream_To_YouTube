The code is designed to run as a continuous service, monitoring streams and handling various failure scenarios automatically. It's particularly useful for maintaining 24/7 rebroadcast streams from Twitch to YouTube while handling various edge cases and failures automatically.

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   VODS don't have muted copyrighted music ***(Unless YouTube copyrighted it)***
*   It is ***automated*** no need for human
*   Don't need to ***download the vods and upload it back to youtube***
*   ***Faster than other vods archivers (e.g. they will need to wait for youtube processing)***
*   If the stream is almost over 12 hours It will cut the stream for not losing the video after 12 hours ***(e.g. subathon)***
*   When receive thind-party takedown notice It will stop immediately and start another stream to protect from getting copyrighted strikes on your channel ***(e.g. playing music or video may cause this)***

<h2>üëé Disadvantage</h2>

Here're some of the project's disadvantage:

* If you don't have ***twitch turbo*** or you have turbo but didn't input your token to streamlink, there will be ***ads(commercial break) on the vods***
* Sometimes youtube will cut the stream for no reason or ***thind-party takedown*** and it will causes a ***few minutes of archive video loss***
* This project is still in ***beta*** may have some bugs that didn't fix or found
* Setup can be difficult for people who are not computer savvy

<h2>üßê Definition of the file</h2>

google_auth_oauthlib/flow.py (EDIT FOR AUTOMATED REFRESH API KEY)
